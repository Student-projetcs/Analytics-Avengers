The study of global health and mortality is crucial for fostering a healthier and more equitable world. Analysing health trends at a global level enables us to identify health threats. In addition, analysing global mortality patterns allows us to understand the inequality of healthcare, social determinants and disease burdens in different regions. Identifying high mortality rates will help us to target the relevant resources and interventions to improve healthcare services ultimately reducing avoidable deaths. Understanding global mortality and health is vital to foster a healthier and more equitable world. Equipping us with the understanding and knowledge required to address health issues and challenges, respond to global threats and world collectively as a global family to strive for a healthier and happier future regardless of location or status.

The study of global trends and challenges on a global scale also enables policymaker and healthcare professionals to make informed decision to device and implement effective interventions that will ultimately improve health on a global scale and importantly, save lives.
